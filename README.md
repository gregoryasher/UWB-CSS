Currently I am a Computer Engineering student at the University of Washington Bothell campus. Per curriculum, I take 1 year of Electrical Engineering courses and 1 year of Computer Science and Software Engineering courses. 

On this Github you will find all of my works from the program including the Electrical Engineering department. I have done my best to keep everything organized and to include each assignments specifications. If I am missing anything please point it out so that I may fix the issue.
